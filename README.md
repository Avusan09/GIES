This is a github repo for Gadgets Information and Ecommerce System a learning project for PHP and AJAX and mastering HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.

This project is about a ecommerce website that gives information about Gadgets ( mostly PC, Laptops and mobiles ).

This project is divided into multiple iterations.
1. First iteration includes a fully functional website that provides information and reviews (most of which will be dummy- this is just a practice DUH!)

2. Secondly, this project will have actual data from official sites on thier specifications and real reviews ( ill still be doing those reviews based on the specs).

3. Finally this project will list the prices of the gadget in the multiple websites. 

This will be mostly private for a while, but nothing is private in github so if you find this before, good luck understanding it.
